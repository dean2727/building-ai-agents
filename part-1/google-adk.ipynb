    "1. Check weather (London): The get_weather_stateful tool should read the initial \"Celsius\" preference from the session state initialized in Section 1. The root agent's final response (the weather report in Celsius) should get saved to `state['last_weather_report']` via the `output_key` configuration.\n",
    "2. Manually update state: We will directly modify the state stored within the `InMemorySessionService` instance (`session_service_stateful`).\n",
    "Why direct modification? The `session_service.get_session()` method returns a copy of the session. Modifying that copy wouldn't affect the state used in subsequent agent runs. For this testing scenario with `InMemorySessionService`, we access the internal sessions dictionary to change the actual stored state value for `user_preference_temperature_unit` to \"Fahrenheit\". Note: In real applications, state changes are typically triggered by tools or agent logic returning `EventActions(state_delta=...)`, not direct manual updates.\n",
    "3. Check weather again (New York): The `get_weather_stateful` tool should now read the updated \"Fahrenheit\" preference from the state and convert the temperature accordingly. The root agent's new response (weather in Fahrenheit) will overwrite the previous value in `state['last_weather_report']` due to the output_key.\n",
    "4. Greet the agent: Verify that delegation to the greeting_agent still works correctly alongside the stateful operations. This interaction will become the last response saved by output_key in this specific sequence.\n",
    "5. Inspect final state: After the conversation, we retrieve the session one last time (getting a copy) and print its state to confirm the `user_preference_temperature_unit` is indeed \"Fahrenheit\", observe the final value saved by `output_key` (which will be the greeting in this run), and see the last_city_checked_stateful value written by the tool."

    "\n",
    "Now, we'll add another layer of control after the LLM has decided to use a tool but before that tool actually executes. This is useful for validating the arguments the LLM wants to pass to the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK provides the `before_tool_callback` for this precise purpose. - It's a Python function executed just before a specific tool function runs, after the LLM has requested its use and decided on the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Validate tool arguments, prevent tool execution based on specific inputs, modify arguments dynamically, or enforce resource usage policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Argument Validation: Check if arguments provided by the LLM are valid, within allowed ranges, or conform to expected formats.\n",
    "- Resource Protection: Prevent tools from being called with inputs that might be costly, access restricted data, or cause unwanted side effects (e.g., blocking API calls for certain parameters).\n",
    "- Dynamic Argument Modification: Adjust arguments based on session state or other contextual information before the tool runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a function accepting tool: BaseTool, args: Dict[str, Any], and tool_context: ToolContext.\n",
    "- tool: The tool object about to be called (inspect tool.name).\n",
    "- args: The dictionary of arguments the LLM generated for the tool.\n",
    "- tool_context: Provides access to session state (tool_context.state), agent info, etc.\n",
    "Inside the function:\n",
    "- Inspect: Examine the tool.name and the args dictionary.\n",
    "- Modify: Change values within the args dictionary directly. If you return None, the tool runs with these modified args.\n",
    "- Block/Override (Guardrail): Return a dictionary. ADK treats this dictionary as the result of the tool call, completely skipping the execution of the original tool - function. The dictionary should ideally match the expected return format of the tool it's blocking.\n",
    "- Allow: Return None. ADK proceeds to execute the actual tool function with the (potentially modified) arguments."
